# Code of Conduct

Etchy is meant to be a collaborative, experimental art tool, and I don't want anyone to feel unsafe or uncomfortable while using it. 

Above all, if you want to use Etchy, you have to agree:

* never share unwelcome or non-consensual sexual content. 
* never harass or make another user feel unsafe or unwelcome.
* never threaten or intimidate another user.
* no sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language

*No tolerance for bigots and creeps*

If you have any issues or have suggestions or comments or anything, let me know, either at austin(dot)slominski(at)gmail(dotcom) or on Twitter (@aceslowman)
